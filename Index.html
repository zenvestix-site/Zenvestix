Renovation Management
            
We handle every detail — from scope creation to final punch list. Our process covers budgeting, design coordination, permit management, vendor selection, scheduling, and quality control. Each project is tracked through live dashboards showing progress, costs, and timelines in real time. We oversee bids, permits, inspections, and materials to ensure your investment stays on track, on budget, and compliant — no surprises, just execution.

Short-Term Rental (STR) Setup
                    
We take your property from empty to income-producing. Zenvestix manages the full STR process — renovation, design, furnishing, tech, and launch. Our team handles property planning, contractor coordination, interior setup, and automation installation (smart locks, thermostats, cameras, Wi-Fi, PMS). Once complete, we optimize your listing, pricing, and guest flow so it performs from day one. You get a turnkey, fully branded, and revenue-ready STR built to run itself.
